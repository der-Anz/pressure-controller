# Pressure-controller

## Aim

This code is intended to create different pressure patterns to stimulate an automated test rig for verification.  

## On the Hard(ware) side

At the moment the pressure-controller rely on an Arduino Mega 2560 board and a 2SMPP-03 gauge pressure sensor.

## To do

At the moment i try to generate a state machine to wrap around my ugly if statement code.
